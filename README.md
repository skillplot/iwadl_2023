## Day 1: FCNN and Basics of ML

For understanding, tweaking, experimenting with hyperparameters mentioned in the lectures to understand what affects training process. 
And breaks the notion that adding more and more layers is not the universal solution to get better accuracy.

Tip: Try out every combination, the simulation won't break

## Day 2: Convolutional Neural Networks (Reference Material)

1. Convnets playground to visualise the channels, filters, feature maps, and how the convnets learn from edges to patterns to parts as we go deeper into the layers. Interactive Visualisations

2. A very immersive, detailed and fun blog post by Andrej Karpathy (ex-director of AI at Tesla) explaining the Convnets and how they work http://karpathy.github.io/2015/10/25/selfie/



## Day 3


### LSTM

Just click the button "Open in colab" when you open the below link. Or use the attached .ipynb for the same. Lab session timing would be announced later Dr. Aditya Nigam.
